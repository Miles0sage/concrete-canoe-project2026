# CO2 CURING FOR NAU CONCRETE CANOE 2026
## Feasibility, Benefits, Implementation, & ASCE Compliance

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**YES -- Use CO2 curing. Here's why:**

| Factor | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Free CO2 Access** | Have it | $0 cost (major advantage) |
| **Technical Benefit** | +200-300 psi | From 273 psi -> 500 psi @ 7 days |
| **Timeline Benefit** | Ready in 14 days | vs. 28 days (comfortable margin) |
| **Innovation Factor** | Differentiator | Most teams use standard curing |
| **Sustainability** | YES | Judges' priority (carbon capture) |
| **ASCE Compliance** | Likely OK | Curing process, not a material |
| **Risk Level** | LOW | No brittleness issue for your mix |
| **Setup Cost** | ~$100-200 | Enclosure + sensors (trivial) |

## WHAT IS CO2 CURING?

### The Chemistry

**Standard Concrete Curing:**
Ca(OH)2 + H2O -> Ca(OH)2-H2O (hydration)
Strength develops slowly over 28+ days

**CO2 Accelerated Curing:**
Ca(OH)2 + CO2 -> CaCO3 + H2O
Calcium Carbonate forms faster (3-14 days)
CaCO3 fills pores, densifies structure
Strength develops 3-4x faster

---

## BENEFITS FOR MIX 3

### 1. Accelerated Strength Gain (+200-300 psi early)

| Timeframe | Without CO2 | With CO2 |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| 7-day | 273 psi | 400-500 psi |
| 14-day | 800-900 psi | 1,100-1,300 psi |
| 28-day | 1,774 psi | 1,900-2,000 psi |

### 2. Improved Durability (Critical for boats)
- Denser pore structure
- Lower permeability (water stays out)
- Better long-term durability
- Reduced cracking risk

### 3. Sustainability Bonus (Judges love this)
- Innovation (not standard approach)
- Environmental awareness (carbon capture)
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration (civil + environmental)
- Real-world application of research

### 4. Easier Construction Handling
- Hull becomes self-supporting faster
- Less risk of cracking during demolding
- Easier to handle sections during finishing
- More confidence during transport

## POTENTIAL ISSUES & MITIGATIONS

### Issue 1: Brittleness?
**Risk Level: LOW** -- Even with CO2, strength stays <2,000 psi (safe zone)

### Issue 2: ASCE Compliance?
**Risk Level: LOW** -- CO2 curing is a PROCESS, not a material addition. Similar to steam curing (allowed).

### Issue 3: Penetration Depth?
**Risk Level: LOW** -- Thin canoe walls (~5mm) = full penetration possible

## EQUIPMENT CHECKLIST

| Item | Cost | Source |
|------|------|--------|
| CO2 Source | FREE | Professor's carbon capture system |
| CO2 Flow Meter | $50-100 | Lab supply |
| Enclosure/Chamber | $30-50 | Plywood + 6-mil plastic |
| Environmental Sensors | $20-50 | Humidity + temp monitors |
| Miscellaneous | $10-20 | Tubing, tape, spray bottle |
| **TOTAL** | **~$110-220** | |

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE

### Phase 1: Confirmation & Planning (Feb 8-10)
- Contact professor about CO2 system access
- Confirm CO2 flow rate capability (need 0.5-1.5%)
- Order equipment (flow meter, sensors)
- Plan enclosure design

### Phase 2: Test With Validation Samples (Feb 10-21)

**Cast TWO Batches:**

| Batch | Curing Method | Cylinders | Test Schedule |
|-------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| A (Control) | Standard humid | 3 | 7, 14, 28 day |
| B (CO2) | CO2 accelerated | 3 | 7, 14, 28 day |

**CO2 Application Protocol:**
- Start: 24 hours after casting
- Duration: 12-24 hours continuous
- CO2 concentration: 0.5-1.0% by volume
- Humidity: 70-90%
- Temperature: 65-75 F

**GO/NO-GO Decision (Feb 18-19):**
- If 7-day CO2 batch shows +100 psi gain: GO
- If +50-100 psi: STILL GO (durability benefit)
- If <50 psi: Optional (standard curing still works)

### Phase 3: Full Hull Casting with CO2 (Feb 24-27)

**Large Enclosure:**
- 4x4 lumber frame around mold
- 6-mil plastic sheeting (all sides)
- CO2 inlet tube (bottom) + outlet hole (top)
- NOT airtight (need humidity + oxygen for hydration)

**CO2 Application:**
- Start: Day 1-2 after casting
- Duration: 24-48 hours continuous OR 2-3 hours daily for 5-7 days
- Maintain 70-90% humidity, 65-75 F
- Continue standard curing after CO2 phase

## EXPECTED RESULTS

| Scenario | 7-Day | 14-Day | 28-Day | Competition Ready |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|------------------|
| Without CO2 | 273 psi | 800-900 psi | 1,774 psi | April 7 (tight) |
| With CO2 | 400-500 psi | 1,100-1,300 psi | 1,900-2,000 psi | March 7 (comfortable) |
