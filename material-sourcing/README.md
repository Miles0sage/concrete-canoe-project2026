Acquire Poraver or equivalent lightweight aggregate for concrete canoe construction through local Flagstaff suppliers.

## 📞 Phone Script for Suppliers

### Opening Script
```
"Hi! My name is [NAME], and I'm a student at NAU working on an engineering 
project - we're building a concrete canoe! I'm wondering if you carry or have 
access to Poraver lightweight aggregate, or similar expanded glass products for 
lightweight concrete?"

[Listen to response]

"We only need a small quantity for our student project - maybe 10-20 pounds. 
Since this is an educational project, would there be any possibility of a 
donation or student discount? We can pick it up whenever is convenient!"
```

### Key Points to Mention
1. ✅ NAU student project (educational)
2. ✅ Small quantity needed
3. ✅ Can pick up immediately (no shipping hassle)
4. ✅ Recognition in project presentation/documentation
5. ✅ Building relationship with local supplier

### If They Don't Have Poraver

lightweight aggregates or expanded glass products? We're also open to similar 
materials that could work for lightweight concrete."

## 📝 Notes & Lessons Learned

### Key Insights
1. **Poraver doesn't donate directly** - must go through retailers
2. **Local suppliers are more responsive** - face-to-face works better
3. **Small quantities are perfect** - makes donation more feasible
4. **Educational angle is powerful** - suppliers like supporting students

### Best Practices
- Call during business hours (avoid Monday mornings)
- Ask for manager/purchasing department
- Be prepared to explain concrete canoe concept
- Follow up within 1 week if no response
- Send thank you notes for donations
