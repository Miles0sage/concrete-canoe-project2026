## EMAIL 1: PORAVER ⭐ (Highest Priority!)

**To:** info@poraver.com  
**Subject:** NAU Concrete Canoe - Poraver Donation Request

---

Dear Poraver Team,

I'm a civil engineering student at Northern Arizona University reaching out about our ASCE Concrete Canoe project.

We're competing in the Pacific Southwest Regional Competition this spring, and Poraver expanded glass is central to our hull design. The challenge in concrete canoe is creating a mix that floats while maintaining structural integrity—Poraver's low-density aggregate (SG ~0.3) is exactly what we need to achieve our target hull weight under 200 lbs.

We're requesting a donation of approximately 50 lbs of Poraver beads (est. retail ~$150-200). In return:

• Poraver logo displayed on our canoe hull  
• Recognition in our technical paper and presentation  
• Social media coverage throughout the build  
• Competition photos featuring your materials

I know Poraver has supported other concrete canoe teams, and we'd be honored to continue that tradition. We can coordinate shipping to Flagstaff, AZ or arrange pickup.

Happy to share our preliminary mix designs if helpful.

Thank you!

## EMAIL 2: CEMEX FLAGSTAFF ⭐ (Local Plant!)

**To:** cemexusa.com/contact-us (use web form)  
**Subject:** NAU Concrete Canoe - Local Flagstaff Sponsorship Request

---

Dear CEMEX Flagstaff Team,

I'm a civil engineering student at NAU reaching out about a sponsorship opportunity with your Flagstaff Ready-Mix plant.

Our team is competing in the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition—designing and building a canoe made entirely of concrete that floats and races. It's one of the most hands-on engineering challenges for civil engineering students.

Since CEMEX has a plant right here in Flagstaff, we thought you might be interested in supporting local NAU engineering students. We're looking for:

• Portland cement (4-5 bags)  
• Any lightweight or specialty materials you'd recommend

In exchange, sponsors receive:
• Logo on our competition canoe  
• Recognition in our technical presentation  
• Social media posts featuring CEMEX materials  
• Photos from competition day

We can pick up materials directly from your Flagstaff location—no shipping needed.

Is there someone at the Flagstaff plant I could speak with about this?

Go Lumberjacks!

## EMAIL 3: QUIKRETE

**To:** quikrete.com/ContactUs/Main.asp (web form)  
**Subject:** NAU Concrete Canoe - Student Project Material Request

---

Dear QUIKRETE Team,

I'm a civil engineering student at Northern Arizona University working on our Concrete Canoe project for the ASCE regional competition.

Our team designs, mixes, and builds a canoe made entirely of concrete that has to float, race, and survive a "swamp test." It's an incredible hands-on application of materials science and structural engineering.

We're looking for donated materials to support our build:
• QUIKRETE Portland Cement (4-5 bags)  
• Any lightweight concrete products you'd suggest

In exchange, we'd feature the QUIKRETE logo on our canoe and include you in all sponsor acknowledgments and social media.

We're in Flagstaff, AZ and can pick up from your Phoenix distribution or coordinate shipping.

Would someone on your community relations team be available to discuss?

Thank you!

## EMAIL 4: CALPORTLAND

**To:** calportland.com/contact-us (web form)  
**Subject:** NAU Concrete Canoe - Arizona Sponsorship Opportunity

---

Dear CalPortland Team,

I'm reaching out from the NAU Concrete Canoe team about a sponsorship opportunity.

We're civil engineering students at Northern Arizona University competing in the ASCE Pacific Southwest Regional Competition. Our challenge: design and build a concrete canoe that floats, races, and showcases innovative materials engineering.

As a major supplier with Arizona locations, CalPortland is an ideal partner for our project. We're looking for:
• Portland cement  
• Lightweight aggregates or sand

Sponsors receive:
• Logo placement on our competition canoe  
• Recognition in our technical paper and presentation  
• Social media coverage  
• Competition day photos

We're in Flagstaff and can pick up from any convenient Arizona location.

Would you be open to discussing sponsorship?

Best regards,

## EMAIL 5: SIKA USA (Admixtures)

**To:** usa.sika.com/en/contact-sika-usa.html (use contact form)  
**Subject:** NAU Concrete Canoe - Admixture Donation Request

---

Dear Sika Team,

I'm a civil engineering student at NAU competing in the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition, and I'm reaching out about admixture sponsorship.

Getting the mix design right is the hardest part of concrete canoe—balancing workability, strength, and density so the canoe actually floats. Quality admixtures make or break the project.

We're looking for:
• Air-entraining admixture (critical for reducing density)  
• Water-reducing admixture (for workability without excess water)  
• Fiber reinforcement (if available)

I saw that Sika partners with universities on research and education. We'd be honored to feature Sika in our sponsor acknowledgments, display your logo on our canoe, and share photos from competition.

Does Sika have a student project or sample program we could apply to? Or is there an Arizona regional rep I could connect with?

Thank you!
