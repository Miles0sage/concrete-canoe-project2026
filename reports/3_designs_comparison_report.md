# NAU ASCE Concrete Canoe 2026 — 3 Alternative Designs Comparison

## Executive Summary

Three hull designs were analysed for the 2026 ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition. Each design uses **60 PCF lightweight concrete** with **1500 psi flexural strength** and **0.5" wall thickness**.

Loading condition: canoe shell + 4 paddlers @ 175 lbs each (700 lbs total crew).

**Result: 3 of 3 designs pass all ASCE compliance checks.**
**Recommended: Design A** — Minimum weight while meeting all requirements

## ASCE Compliance Requirements

| Metric | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Freeboard | >= 6 inches |
| Metacentric Height (GM) | >= 6 inches |
| Safety Factor | >= 2.0 |
| Target Weight | <= 237 lbs |

## Detailed Comparison

| Metric | Design A | Design B | Design C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Length (in) | 192 | 196 | 216 |
| Beam (in) | 32 | 34 | 36 |
| Depth (in) | 17 | 18 | 18 |
| Thickness (in) | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| Shell Weight (lbs) | 163.1 | 176.6 | 200.5 |
| Total Canoe Weight (lbs) | 171.3 | 185.4 | 210.6 |
| Loaded Weight (lbs) | 871.3 | 885.4 | 910.6 |
| Draft (in) | 6.0 | 5.7 | 5.0 |
| Freeboard (in) | 11.0 PASS | 12.3 PASS | 13.0 PASS |
| GM (in) | 9.5 PASS | 11.7 PASS | 16.0 PASS |
| Safety Factor | 5.55 PASS | 6.01 PASS | 5.34 PASS |
| Bending Stress (psi) | 270 | 250 | 281 |
| **OVERALL** | **PASS** | **PASS** | **PASS** |

## Design Analysis

### Design A: Optimal (Lightest)
*Minimum weight while meeting all requirements*

**Pros:**
- Lightest design — best for competition weight scoring
- Smallest footprint — easier to transport and store
- Most efficient use of materials

**Cons:**
- Tightest margins on stability and freeboard
- Less forgiving of construction variations
- Narrower beam may reduce paddler comfort

### Design B: Conservative (Safety Margin)
*Extra safety margin on all requirements*

**Pros:**
- Good balance of weight and safety margin
- Wider beam provides comfortable paddling
- Extra freeboard for rough water conditions

**Cons:**
- Slightly heavier than Design A
- May be over-engineered if conditions are calm
- Moderate material usage

### Design C: Traditional (Easy Build)
*Standard proportions, easier construction*

**Pros:**
- Standard proportions simplify construction
- Maximum stability and freeboard
- Most forgiving of construction tolerances
- Best for teams with less building experience

**Cons:**
- Heaviest design — worst weight score
- Largest material requirements
- Longer hull harder to transport
- Reduced maneuverability due to length

## Recommendation

**Design A** is the recommended design.

- Weight: **171.3 lbs** (target: 237.0 lbs)
- Freeboard: **11.0"** (requirement: >= 6.0")
- GM: **9.5"** (requirement: >= 6.0")
- Safety Factor: **5.55** (requirement: >= 2.0)
