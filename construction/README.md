## 🔧 Tools & Equipment Needed

### Mold Construction
- [ ] Circular saw
- [ ] Sander/grinder
- [ ] Measuring tools
- [ ] Screws/fasteners
- [ ] Wood glue
- [ ] Release agent

### Concrete Work
- [ ] Mixing buckets/containers
- [ ] Trowels (various sizes)
- [ ] Sponges

## ⚠️ Safety Protocols

### Concrete Safety
1. **Skin protection:** Wet concrete is caustic - always wear gloves
2. **Respiratory:** Wear dust mask when mixing cement
3. **Eye protection:** Safety glasses during grinding/sanding
4. **Ventilation:** Work in well-ventilated area

### Workshop Safety
1. Power tool safety - training required
2. First aid kit on site
3. Emergency contacts posted
4. Clean workspace to prevent trips/falls

## 📊 Quality Control Checkpoints

### Mold QC
