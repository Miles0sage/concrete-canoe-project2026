# NAU Concrete Canoe 2026 — Female Mold Construction Guide
## Step-by-Step Build Instructions for Design A (192" x 32" x 17")

---

## What is a Female Mold?

A **female mold** is a hollow form that you lay concrete INTO. The mold's inner surface shapes the canoe's outer surface, so you get a smooth, fair hull without extensive finishing. This is the opposite of a male mold (where you lay concrete OVER the form).

**Why female mold?**
- Smoother outer hull = less drag in water
- Better dimensional control
- Easier to get uniform wall thickness
- Industry standard for competition canoes

## STEP 1: Build the Strongback (Days 1-2)

### What It Is
The strongback is a flat, rigid spine that supports the foam mold sections. Think of it as the table the mold sits on. It MUST be straight and level or your canoe will be crooked.

### How To Do It

1. **Get your MDF board**: 3/4" thick, 36" wide, 16 feet long. If you can only find 8-foot sheets, join two with a plywood splice plate on the bottom (24" long, screwed every 4").

2. **Set it on sawhorses**: Place at least 4 sawhorses evenly spaced. The top of the MDF should be about waist height (36") so you can work comfortably.

3. **Level it**: Use a long level or a string line. Shim the sawhorses until the strongback is dead flat. This is critical — any twist here becomes a twist in your canoe.

4. **Draw the centerline**: Snap a chalk line down the exact center of the MDF (18" from each edge). All foam sections will be centered on this line.

5. **Mark station locations**: Starting from one end (bow), mark lines across the strongback every 6 inches. You'll have 33 lines (stations 0 through 32). Label them with a Sharpie.

### Check Your Work
- [ ] Strongback is level within 1/8" over its full length
- [ ] Centerline is straight
- [ ] All 33 station marks are accurate (measure twice!)

---

## STEP 2: Cut the Foam Cross-Sections (Days 2-4)

### What You're Making
You're cutting 33 foam pieces, each shaped like the canoe's cross-section at that point. Station 0 (bow) is tiny/pointed. Station 16 (midship) is the widest at 32". Station 32 (stern) tapers back to a point.

### Station Dimensions (Design A)

| Station | Position (in) | Half-Beam (in) | Depth (in) | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 | Bow tip — no foam needed |
| 1 | 6 | 1.6 | 3.2 | Very narrow |
| 2 | 12 | 3.1 | 5.3 | |
| 3 | 18 | 4.7 | 7.3 | |
| 4 | 24 | 6.1 | 9.0 | |
| 5 | 30 | 7.6 | 10.5 | |
| 6 | 36 | 8.9 | 11.7 | |
| 7 | 42 | 10.2 | 12.8 | |
| 8 | 48 | 11.3 | 13.7 | |
| 9 | 54 | 12.4 | 14.5 | |
| 10 | 60 | 13.3 | 15.1 | |
| 11 | 66 | 14.1 | 15.6 | |
| 12 | 72 | 14.8 | 16.0 | |
| 13 | 78 | 15.3 | 16.3 | |
| 14 | 84 | 15.7 | 16.5 | |
| 15 | 90 | 15.9 | 16.8 | |
| 16 | 96 | 16.0 | 17.0 | WIDEST — Midship |
| 17 | 102 | 15.9 | 16.8 | Mirror of 15 |
| 18 | 108 | 15.7 | 16.5 | Mirror of 14 |
| 19 | 114 | 15.3 | 16.3 | Mirror of 13 |
| 20 | 120 | 14.8 | 16.0 | Mirror of 12 |
| 21 | 126 | 14.1 | 15.6 | Mirror of 11 |
| 22 | 132 | 13.3 | 15.1 | Mirror of 10 |
| 23 | 138 | 12.4 | 14.5 | Mirror of 9 |
| 24 | 144 | 11.3 | 13.7 | Mirror of 8 |
| 25 | 150 | 10.2 | 12.8 | Mirror of 7 |
| 26 | 156 | 8.9 | 11.7 | Mirror of 6 |
| 27 | 162 | 7.6 | 10.5 | Mirror of 5 |
| 28 | 168 | 6.1 | 9.0 | Mirror of 4 |
| 29 | 174 | 4.7 | 7.3 | Mirror of 3 |
| 30 | 180 | 3.1 | 5.3 | Mirror of 2 |
| 31 | 186 | 1.6 | 3.2 | Mirror of 1 |
| 32 | 192 | 0.0 | 0 | Stern tip — no foam needed |

**Note**: Half-Beam is the distance from centerline to each side. The full beam at any station is 2x the half-beam. The canoe is symmetric, so stations 17-31 mirror stations 15-1.

### How To Cut

1. **Make templates first**: On cardboard or thin plywood, draw the cross-section shape for each unique station (you only need 16 templates since the canoe is symmetric bow-to-stern). The shape is a U-profile: flat bottom with sides angling up.

2. **Transfer to foam**: Trace the template onto the EPS foam sheets. Each cross-section piece should be 6" thick (or laminate thinner sheets to get 6").

3. **Cut with hot wire cutter** (preferred): Gives clean, accurate cuts. Follow the traced line slowly. If you don't have a hot wire, use a serrated knife or jigsaw with a foam blade.

4. **For the female mold**: Each foam piece needs to have the canoe shape CUT OUT of it, not cut as a solid piece. You're making a negative shape — a trough that the concrete goes INTO.
   - Start with a rectangular foam block (at least as wide as the beam + 4" margin on each side, and as tall as the depth + 2" margin)
   - Cut the U-shaped canoe cross-section OUT of the top of each block
   - The result looks like a rectangular block with a trough/valley carved in it

5. **Label every piece**: Write the station number on both sides with Sharpie.

### Check Your Work
- [ ] All sections match their template dimensions within 1/4"
- [ ] Sections get progressively wider from bow to midship
- [ ] Midship section (Station 16) is exactly 32" wide at the top of the trough
- [ ] All sections are 6" thick (fore-aft direction)

---

## STEP 3: Assemble the Mold (Days 4-5)

### How To Do It

1. **Start at midship (Station 16)**: This is your reference section. Center it on the strongback centerline at the 96" mark. Glue the bottom with construction adhesive and screw through the bottom into the MDF (from below if possible, or use angle brackets).

2. **Work outward**: Install stations 15 and 17 next, then 14 and 18, etc. Each one should be:
   - Exactly 6" from the previous station (measure from face to face)
   - Centered on the centerline
   - Level with the tops of adjacent sections

3. **Glue between sections**: Apply construction adhesive between each foam section. Clamp or weight them while the glue sets (2-4 hours).

4. **Fill the gaps**: The 6" spaces between foam sections need to be filled to create a continuous surface. Use:
   - Strips of foam glued in and carved to shape, OR
   - Spray foam insulation (Great Stuff), then carve flush after it cures

5. **Fair the surface**: This is the most important and time-consuming step.
   - Use a surform rasp to knock down high spots
   - Use a long sanding board (2' straightedge with sandpaper glued to it) to check for fairness
   - Work from 80 grit → 120 grit → 220 grit
   - The inside of the mold should be smooth to the touch with no bumps, dips, or ridges
   - Run your hand along it — you should feel zero transitions between foam sections
   - Use Bondo or lightweight spackle to fill any dips or voids

6. **Check fairness**: Lay a flexible batten (thin strip of wood) along the mold surface fore-and-aft. It should touch the surface continuously with no gaps larger than 1/16".

### Check Your Work
- [ ] All sections are firmly attached and don't wiggle
- [ ] Surface is fair — no bumps or hollows
- [ ] Interior dimensions match design: 192" long, 32" wide at midship, 17" deep
- [ ] Mold is symmetric — measure beam at each station on both sides of centerline

---

## STEP 4: Prepare the Mold Surface (Days 6-7)

### Why This Matters
If you skip this step or do it badly, the concrete will stick to the foam and your canoe will break during demolding.

### How To Do It

1. **Final sand**: Go over the entire interior surface with 220-grit sandpaper. Remove all dust with a vacuum or tack cloth.

2. **Apply PVA mold release — Coat 1**:
   - Use a foam brush or spray bottle
   - Apply a thin, even coat over the ENTIRE interior surface
   - Let it dry completely (1-2 hours until it's clear/glossy)
   - Don't touch it with bare hands after application

3. **Apply PVA mold release — Coat 2**:
   - Apply a second coat perpendicular to the first (if you brushed side-to-side first time, go fore-aft this time)
   - Let it dry completely (another 1-2 hours)
   - The surface should now feel slick and glossy

4. **Optional — Coat 3**: For extra insurance, apply a third coat. Better safe than sorry on your first build.

### Check Your Work
- [ ] Surface is uniformly glossy
- [ ] No dry spots or missed areas
- [ ] No fingerprints or smudges in the release coat
- [ ] Release agent extends all the way to the top edges (gunwale area)

---

## STEP 5: Place the Reinforcement — First Layer (Day 8)

### What You're Using
**Basalt fiber mesh** — a woven fabric made from volcanic basite rock fibers. It's like fiberglass but stronger, lighter, and doesn't irritate skin as badly. It provides tensile strength (resistance to stretching/cracking) that concrete lacks on its own.

### How To Do It

1. **Pre-cut the mesh**: Cut pieces that will drape into the mold with about 2" overlap on the gunwale edges. For a 192" canoe, you'll likely need:
   - 2-3 full-length pieces (each ~200" x 40") overlapping by 3-4" along their lengths
   - OR many smaller pieces overlapping by at least 3" in all directions

2. **Dry-fit first**: Lay the mesh into the mold WITHOUT any concrete. Make sure it conforms to the shape, especially in the bottom curves. Trim any areas that bunch up or won't lay flat.

3. **Make relief cuts**: At the bow and stern where the mold narrows, the mesh will want to bunch up. Make small cuts (darts) so it can lay flat around the curves. Overlap the cut edges by at least 2".

4. **Remove the mesh and set aside**: You'll place it back during concrete application.

### Check Your Work
- [ ] Mesh covers the entire interior surface
- [ ] No gaps larger than 1" between mesh pieces
- [ ] Overlaps are at least 3" everywhere
- [ ] Mesh lies relatively flat with no severe bunching

---

## STEP 6: Mix and Apply Concrete — First Lift (Day 9)

### The Mix
Your lightweight concrete mix should target approximately 60 PCF (pounds per cubic foot). A typical competition mix:

| Ingredient | Parts by Weight | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Portland cement (Type I) | 1.00 | The binder |
| Poraver (0.5-1mm grade) | 0.40 | Lightweight aggregate |
| Poraver (1-2mm grade) | 0.30 | Lightweight aggregate |
| Fly ash (Class F) | 0.15 | Improite workability |
| Silica fume | 0.05 | Adds strength and density |
| Water | 0.35 (w/c ratio) | Adjust for workability |
| HRWR (water reducer) | 0.005 | Makes mix flowable with less water |
| PVA fibers (12mm chopped) | 0.02 | Micro-crack resistance |

**Test batch first!** Mix a small batch (1/10 scale), make a test panel, and verify:
- Workability (it should spread easily with a trowel but not be runny)
- Set time (should be workable for at least 45 minutes)
- Cure it 7 days and weigh a known volume to verify density

### First Lift Application

1. **Mix the concrete**: Mix in small batches (about 2 gallons at a time) so it doesn't set before you can place it. Use a drill with a mixing paddle.

2. **Start at the bottom center**: Apply concrete to the bottom of the mold first, working from midship toward bow and stern.

3. **Target thickness: 0.20 inches** (about 5mm) for the first lift. Use a thickness gauge or a marked stick to check frequently.

4. **Work up the sides**: After the bottom, work up the sidewalls. The concrete may want to sag on the sides — work in thin layers and let each one tack up slightly before adding more.

5. **Press firmly**: Use a trowel to press the concrete into the mold surface, eliminating air bubbles. Work in one direction.

6. **Place the basalt mesh**: While the first lift is still wet/tacky, lay the pre-cut basalt mesh into it. Press it gently into the concrete so it's embedded but not pushed all the way to the mold surface.

7. **Work out bubbles**: Use a roller or your trowel to press the mesh into the concrete. You should see concrete squeezing up through the mesh weave.

### Check Your Work
- [ ] First lift covers the entire mold interior
- [ ] Thickness is approximately 0.20" (check with gauge)
- [ ] Mesh is fully embedded in the first lift
- [ ] No dry spots or areas where mesh isn't touching concrete
- [ ] No large air bubbles visible

---

## STEP 7: Apply Concrete — Second Lift (Day 9-10)

### Timing
The second lift should go on while the first lift is still wet or at most "green" (firm but not fully set). Ideally within 2-4 hours of the first lift. If it sets overnight, mist the surface with water before applying the second lift.

### How To Do It

1. **Mix fresh concrete**: Same recipe as the first lift.

2. **Apply over the mesh**: Starting from the bottom, apply the second lift over the basalt mesh. Target thickness: 0.30 inches (about 7-8mm).

3. **Total wall thickness: 0.50 inches** (12.7mm). The combined first lift (0.20") + mesh + second lift (0.30") should equal half an inch.

4. **Smooth the surface**: This inner surface is what you'll see inside the canoe. Use a flexible steel trowel to make it as smooth as possible. Dampen the trowel with water for a better finish.

5. **Build up the gunwales**: The top edge of the canoe needs to be slightly thicker (0.625"-0.75") for strength. Add a small bead of extra concrete along the top rim.

6. **Trowel finish**: After the concrete starts to firm up (30-60 min after placement), do a final trowel pass. Press firmly and work in long, smooth strokes.

### Check Your Work
- [ ] Total wall thickness is approximately 0.50" everywhere
- [ ] Gunwales are slightly thicker (0.625"-0.75")
- [ ] Inner surface is smooth and even
- [ ] No exposed mesh fibers visible on the inner surface
- [ ] No cracks or separations between lifts

---

## STEP 8: Curing (Days 10-17)

### Why This Is Critical
Concrete gains strength through hydration — a chemical reaction between cement and water. If the water evaporates before the reaction completes, the concrete will be weak and crack. Proper curing can make the difference between a canoe that survives competition and one that breaks.

### How To Do It

1. **Wait 2-4 hours** after final troweling until the surface is firm to light touch.

2. **Mist the surface**: Use spray bottles to lightly mist the entire inner surface with water.

3. **Cover with plastic**: Drape 6-mil plastic sheeting over the entire mold/canoe. Tuck the edges under or tape them to seal in moisture.

4. **Keep it wet**: Every 12 hours, lift the plastic and mist the surface again. The concrete should always look damp, never dry or light-colored.

5. **Temperature**: Keep the environment between 60-80 degrees F. Don't let it freeze. Don't put it in direct sunlight.

6. **Duration**: Minimum 7 days. 10-14 days is better if you have time.

7. **Don't disturb it**: No poking, prodding, or testing. Don't move the strongback. Don't bump the mold.

### Curing Schedule
| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0 | Concrete placed, initial set |
| 0 + 4hrs | First mist + cover with plastic |
| 1 | Mist morning + evening |
| 2 | Mist morning + evening |
| 3 | Mist morning + evening |
| 4 | Mist morning + evening |
| 5 | Mist morning + evening |
| 6 | Mist morning + evening |
| 7 | Remove plastic, assess surface |
| 7-10 | Optional: continue mist curing for extra strength |

### Check Your Work
- [ ] Plastic stays sealed the entire cure period
- [ ] Surface never dries out (always looks damp when you check)
- [ ] Temperature stayed between 60-80 degrees F
- [ ] No one bumped or moved the mold during curing
- [ ] At Day 7, no visible cracks on the surface

---

## STEP 9: Demolding (Day 18)

### This Is the Scary Part
You're separating your finished concrete canoe from the foam mold. If the release agent worked properly, this should go smoothly. If not... that's why we applied 2-3 coats.

### How To Do It

1. **Gather your team**: You need at minimum 6 people. Schedule this in advance so everyone shows up.

2. **Prepare the landing zone**: Have a padded area ready to set the canoe down — foam blocks covered with moving blankets, or a canoe cradle if you've built one.

3. **Remove the strongback from the sawhorses**: Set the entire mold + canoe assembly on the ground (on padding).

4. **Start peeling foam from the outside**: Begin at the bow or stern where the foam sections are smallest. Use a putty knife to gently work between the foam and concrete. The PVA release agent should let the foam separate cleanly.

5. **Work progressively**: Remove foam sections one at a time, working toward midship. Don't rush. If a section sticks, don't force it — use more putty knife work or gently tap with a rubber mallet.

6. **For stubborn areas**: A heat gun on low can soften the foam slightly and help it release. Or carefully score the foam with a utility knife and peel it away in pieces.

7. **Flip the canoe**: Once all foam is removed from the outside, carefully flip the canoe right-side-up with your 6-person team. Everyone lifts simultaneously on the count of three. Move slowly and support the middle — don't let it flex.

8. **Clean the outer surface**: Remove any foam residue with a plastic scraper (not metal — it'll scratch). Solvent (acetone) can dissolve stubborn EPS residue, but test on a small area first.

### Check Your Work
- [ ] Canoe is out of the mold in one piece (no cracks!)
- [ ] Outer surface is smooth (thanks to the female mold)
- [ ] No structural damage from demolding
- [ ] Canoe sits level on the cradle
- [ ] Wall thickness is uniform (check with calipers at multiple points)

---

## STEP 10: Finishing (Days 19-21)

### Surface Prep

1. **Sand the inner surface**: Use 120 grit to knock down trowel marks, then 220 grit for smoothness. Wet sanding works best and keeps dust down.

2. **Sand the outer surface**: Should already be smooth from the mold. Light 220-grit sanding only to prep for sealer.

3. **Fill any voids**: If there are small pinholes or bug holes, fill with a thin concrete paste (cement + water + a drop of acrylic admixture).

4. **Sand the gunwales**: Round the top edge slightly for comfort and to prevent chipping. Use 120 grit.

### Sealing

1. **Apply penetrating concrete sealer**: Use a brush or roller. Apply to the entire exterior surface. Let it soak in for 15 minutes, then wipe off excess.

2. **Second coat of sealer**: Apply 24 hours after the first coat.

3. **Interior**: Seal the interior surface too — this prevents water from soaking into the concrete and adding weight during races.

### Graphics & Branding

1. **Mark your design areas**: Use painter's tape to mask off areas for team logo, canoe name, and NAU branding.

2. **Apply acrylic latex paint**: Use exterior-grade acrylic paint. Multiple thin coats are better than one thick coat.

3. **Clear coat** (optional): A clear acrylic spray over the graphics protects them from water and abrasion.

### Final Assembly

1. **Weigh the canoe**: Use a bathroom scale or hanging scale. Design A target: 174 lbs. Acceptable range: 160-190 lbs.

2. **Float test**: Fill a pool or pond and carefully set the canoe in. Check that it floats level with the expected freeboard (~11 inches of hull above water when empty).

3. **Stability test**: Sit in it! Have a paddler carefully board and test stability. GM should be noticeable — the canoe should resist tipping and self-right.

4. **Document everything**: Photos and video of the float test for your ASCE presentation.

### Check Your Work
- [ ] Surface is sealed and smooth
- [ ] Graphics look sharp and professional
- [ ] Weight is within acceptable range
- [ ] Float test passed — sits level, correct freeboard
- [ ] Stability test passed — resists tipping
- [ ] All documentation photos taken

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Concrete sticking to mold | Insufficient release agent | Apply more coats next time; use heat gun to soften foam |
| Cracks during curing | Dried out too fast | Mist and re-cover immediately; seal cracks with slurry |
| Canoe too heavy | Wall too thick or concrete too dense | Sand down thick spots; adjust mix for next build |
| Canoe too light/fragile | Wall too thin | Reinforce problem areas with additional mesh + concrete patch |
| Surface rough/bumpy | Poor mold finish | Sand extensively; fill with cement paste |
| Uneven wall thickness | Inconsistent application | Measure frequently during application; use thickness gauge |
| Canoe warps after demolding | Uneven curing or demolding stress | Support in cradle; may self-correct over 24-48 hours |

---

## Safety Reminders

1. **Cement is caustic**: Always wear latex/nitrile gloves when handling wet concrete. If it gets on skin, wash immediately with vinegar then water.
2. **Dust kills lungs**: Wear N95 mask when mixing dry cement or sanding cured concrete. Work outdoors or with ventilation.
3. **Foam cutting fumes**: EPS cutting with hot wire produces styrene fumes. Do it outside or with a fan.
4. **Heavy lifting**: The canoe will weigh 170+ lbs. Always lift with a team. Bend at the knees.
5. **Power tools**: Eye protection and hearing protection when sanding. Keep cords away from water.

*NAU ASCE Concrete Canoe Team 2026 — Design A: 192" x 32" x 17" — Target Weight: 174 lbs*
