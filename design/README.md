# Design Phase

## 🎯 Design Objectives

### Core Requirements
- Floats with 2+ people aboard
- Lightweight enough to carry/transport
- Structurally sound for paddling
- Competition-ready (if entering ASCE competition)

### Design Considerations
- **Weight:** Target total weight under 100 lbs
- **Buoyancy:** Must displace enough water to support crew + canoe
- **Strength:** Reinforcement strategy for thin concrete shell
- **Aesthetics:** Clean lines, professional finish

## 📐 Hull Design

### Dimensions (Typical Concrete Canoe)
- **Length:** 15-20 feet
- **Width:** 30-36 inches at widest point
- **Depth:** 12-15 inches
- **Wall Thickness:** 0.25-0.5 inches

### Design Files
*Store CAD files, sketches, and calculations here*

├── sketches/         # Hand drawings, concept art
└── specifications/   # Material specs, build requirements
```

## 🧮 Critical Calculations

### Buoyancy Calculation
```
Volume displaced = Weight of canoe + Weight of crew + Safety margin
Target: Displace 400-500 lbs of water
```

### Weight Budget
- Concrete shell: ~50-70 lbs
- Reinforcement (mesh/fiber): ~5-10 lbs
- Hardware (seats, etc.): ~5-10 lbs
- **Total target:** <100 lbs

### Concrete Mix Design
*Dependent on aggregate choice (Poraver vs alternatives)*

Key properties to optimize:
- **Density:** As low as possible while maintaining strength
- **Compressive strength:** Adequate for hull loads
- **Workability:** Easy to apply to mold
- **Set time:** Manageable for construction process

## 🏗️ Construction Method Planning

### Mold Strategy
- [ ] Male mold (build canoe over form)
- [ ] Female mold (build canoe inside form)
- [ ] CNC milled foam
- [ ] Hand-shaped foam/plywood

### Reinforcement Strategy
- [ ] Fiberglass mesh
- [ ] Carbon fiber
- [ ] Basalt fiber
- [ ] Wire mesh
- [ ] Combination approach

### Application Method
- [ ] Hand trowel
- [ ] Spray application
- [ ] Layered construction
- [ ] Single pour
