   - Value: $75

3. **Local Masonry Supply**
   - Research Flagstaff masonry/concrete suppliers
   - Call to ask: "Do you carry Poraver expanded glass beads?"
   - Emphasize: NAU engineering students, educational project

### Priority 2: ADMIXTURE SAMPLE PROGRAMS

These companies often have educational sample programs:

1. **Sika Corporation** - education@sika.com
   - Products: Air entraining agent, water reducer
   - Mention: Student learning, will document in technical paper
   - Value: $50-75

2. **BASF Master Builders** - technical@master-builders-solutions.com

   - Educational samples available
   - Value: $40-60

3. **GCP Applied Technologies** - samples@gcpat.com
   - Product: DARAVAIR air entraining

   - Large company with student programs
   - Value: $75

## Poraver Lightweight Aggregate - Action Plan

Since Poraver said to go through retailers:

**Step 1:** Call local Flagstaff suppliers
- "Hi, I'm an NAU civil engineering student building a concrete canoe. Do you carry Poraver expanded glass beads?"
- If YES → "We're seeking donations for our ASCE competition project"
- If NO → "Can you order it? Or who in Flagstaff might stock it?"

**Step 2:** If no local source found
- Research online retailers shipping to AZ
- Check specialized masonry supply in Phoenix (2hr drive)
- Budget to purchase if donations fail (~$200)

**Step 3:** Alternative lightweight aggregates
- Perlite (SG ~0.5) - Less effective but cheaper
- Vermiculite (SG ~0.6) - Available at Home Depot
- Research performance tradeoffs

Subject: Educational Sample Request - NAU Concrete Canoe Competition

Hello,

I'm reaching out from Northern Arizona University's Civil Engineering program. Our team is competing in the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition, where we design and build a concrete canoe that floats and races.

This project requires specialized admixtures to achieve our target properties:
- Density: 65 PCF (vs normal 150 PCF)
- Strength: 1000+ PSI
- Workability for thin-shell application

We're specifically interested in [Product Name] for [specific purpose].

We understand [Company] has an educational sample program. Would sample quantities be available for our student competition project?

We will:
- Document admixture performance in our technical paper
- Provide recognition in our presentation
- Share competition results

This is an excellent hands-on learning opportunity for civil engineering students.

Thank you for supporting engineering education!
