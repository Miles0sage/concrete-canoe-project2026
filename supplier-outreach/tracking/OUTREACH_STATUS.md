## Key Insights

1. **Poraver Strategy Changed:** Must go through retailers, not direct
2. **Local First:** Better success rate with face-to-face in Flagstaff
3. **Sample Programs:** Admixture companies often have educational programs
4. **Backup Plan:** Budget to purchase critical items if donations insufficient

## Budget Backup Plan

If donations don't reach $500:

| Item | Source | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Poraver (10 lbs) | Online retailer | $200 |
| Cement (100 lbs) | Home Depot | $50 |
| Sand/aggregate | Home Depot | $30 |
| Admixtures | Online | $80 |
| **Total Backup** | | **$360** |

**Strategy:** Donations first, purchase only what's missing by Feb 12.
