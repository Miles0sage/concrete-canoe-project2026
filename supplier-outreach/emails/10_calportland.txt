**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity with NAU Concrete Canoe Team

---

Dear Community Relations Team at CalPortland,

I hope this message finds you well! My name is Miles, and I am a Civil Engineering student at Northern Arizona University, proud to represent the NAU Concrete Canoe Team. We are gearing up for the upcoming ASCE National Concrete Canoe Competition, where we will showcase innovative engineering designs and teamwork to construct a buoyant canoe entirely out of concrete.

As a regional supplier with a strong presence in Arizona, CalPortland’s Type I/II Portland cement is essential for our project. Its versatility and performance characteristics are crucial for achieving the structural integrity and weight requirements needed to compete successfully. We believe that a partnership with CalPortland would not only enhance our canoe but also highlight your commitment to supporting local education and innovation.

We are seeking a sponsorship in the form of a donation or samples of your Portland cement, which would greatly assist us in our construction process. In return, we are excited to offer several benefits, including your logo prominently displayed on our canoe hull—visible during competitions, social media recognition, competition photos featuring your brand, acknowledgment in our technical paper, and a certificate from NAU recognizing your support.

We would be happy to manage any logistics required, including shipping costs. I would love to discuss this further and explore how we can work together to make this partnership beneficial. Please feel free to reach me at (928) 254-9179.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to support local students and innovation!

Warm regards,

Miles
