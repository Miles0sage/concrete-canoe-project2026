**Subject:** Sponsorship Opportunity with NAU Concrete Canoe Team  

Dear Sales Team at Poraver North America,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Miles, and I am a proud member of the Northern Arizona University (NAU) Concrete Canoe Team, a dedicated group of civil engineering students competing in the prestigious American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) National Concrete Canoe Competition. This event challenges teams to design, build, and race a canoe made entirely of concrete, showcasing our engineering skills and creativity.

We are reaching out to you because we believe that Poraver's Expanded Glass Aggregate would be an exceptional addition to our canoe project. Your innovative product not only enhances the strength and durability of our design but also significantly reduces its weight, allowing for improved performance on race day.

As we prepare for this year's competition, we would be incredibly grateful for your support through a donation or sample of Expanded Glass Aggregate. In return, we are excited to offer your company significant exposure, including:

- Your logo prominently featured on the canoe hull, visible to all attendees at the competition
- Recognition across our social media platforms, showcasing your support to our followers
- High-quality photos from the event for your use
- Acknowledgment in our technical paper submitted to ASCE
- A certificate of appreciation from NAU

We understand the importance of making this process easy for you, and we are more than happy to cover any shipping costs that may arise. 

We would love to discuss this opportunity further and explore how we can work together to promote engineering excellence and innovation. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at (928) 254-9179, or reply to this email at your convenience.

Thank you for considering our request, and we look forward to the possibility of partnering with Poraver North America.  

Best regards,
