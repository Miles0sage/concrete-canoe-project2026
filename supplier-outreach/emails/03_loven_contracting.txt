**Subject:** Thank You and a Request for Continued Support from the NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Mike, Jon, and Daniel,

I hope this message finds you well! My name is Miles, and I am reaching out on behalf of the NAU Concrete Canoe Team. Firstly, I want to extend our heartfelt gratitude for Loven Contracting's generous cash donation last year. Your support was instrumental in allowing us to enhance our design and construction efforts, ultimately helping us secure a commendable position in the competition.

As we gear up for the 2026 season, we are excited to build upon last year’s achievements. Your partnership has made a significant impact on our team, and we would be incredibly grateful if you would consider a similar donation this year. Your involvement not only aids us in creating a competitive canoe but also nurtures the passion and skills of future engineers at Northern Arizona University.

In appreciation of your support, we offer some valuable sponsor benefits, including:
- Your logo prominently displayed on our canoe hull, ensuring visibility at competitions.
- Recognition on our social media platforms.
- Photos showcasing your brand during the event.
- Acknowledgment in our technical paper.
- A certificate of appreciation from NAU.

If you decide to support us again, we can conveniently arrange for pickup here in Flagstaff, or we can cover shipping if preferred.

Thank you once again for your past support. We would love to continue our partnership and drive innovation together. Please feel free to reach me directly at (928) 254-9179 or via email. I look forward to discussing this further and hope to hear from you soon!

Warm regards,
