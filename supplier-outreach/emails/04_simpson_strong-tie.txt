**Subject:** Thank You and a New Opportunity for Partnership with NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Angel,

I hope this message finds you well! I wanted to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for your generous donation of carbon fiber mesh to the NAU Concrete Canoe Team last year. Your support played a crucial role in the success of our project, enabling us to improve the durability and performance of our canoe, ultimately leading us to a commendable finish at the competition. 

As we gear up for the 2026 season, we are excited to continue our partnership with Simpson Strong-Tie. We kindly request your support once again, whether through the same or similar donation of carbon fiber mesh. Our team is committed to pushing the boundaries of engineering while representing your brand with pride.

In recognition of your contribution, we would be thrilled to showcase your logo on our canoe hull, ensuring high visibility during competitions. Additionally, we will provide social media recognition, photos from the event, acknowledgment in our technical paper, and a certificate of appreciation from NAU. 

If you’re local to Flagstaff, we can easily arrange for pickup at your convenience. Otherwise, we can coordinate shipping details to make the process as smooth as possible.

Thank you again for your continued support. We truly value the relationship we have built and hope to grow it further this season. Please let me know if you would be open to discussing this opportunity—we would love to hear from you!

Warm regards,
