**Subject:** Sponsorship Opportunity with NAU Concrete Canoe Team  

Dear Technical Support Team,  

My name is Miles, and I am a Civil Engineering student at Northern Arizona University, currently leading the NAU Concrete Canoe team. We are excited to participate in the upcoming ASCE national concrete canoe competition, where teams from across the country showcase their innovative designs and engineering skills. Our project not only embodies our technical prowess but also emphasizes sustainability in engineering practices.

To enhance the performance of our canoe, we are seeking sponsorship from Master Builders Solutions, specifically your esteemed superplasticizer admixtures. These products are critical in achieving the optimal workability and durability we need for our canoe, allowing us to create a lightweight yet robust design that can withstand the rigors of competition.

We would be grateful if you could support our team with a donation or samples of your admixtures. In return, we would proudly display your logo on our canoe hull, ensuring visibility during the competition. Additionally, you will receive recognition on our social media platforms, photos from the event, acknowledgment in our technical paper, and a certificate of appreciation from NAU.

As a local company here in Flagstaff, partnering with us not only supports your engineering community but also fosters the growth of future professionals in our field. We will gladly handle any shipping costs to ensure logistics are seamless.

Thank you for considering our request. I would love the opportunity to discuss this further and explore how we can work together. Please feel free to reach me at (928) 254-9179.

Best regards,
