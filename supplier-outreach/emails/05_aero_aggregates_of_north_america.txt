**Subject:** Thank You for Your Support - Request for Continued Partnership with NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Dr. Ratiu,

I hope this message finds you well! On behalf of the NAU Concrete Canoe Team, I would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude for your generous donation of Aero aggregates (lightweight) last year. Your support was instrumental in our success, enabling us to enhance the performance and efficiency of our canoe, which ultimately contributed to our team securing a competitive position at the regional competition.

As we gear up for the 2026 season, we would be thrilled to continue our partnership with Aero Aggregates of North America. We kindly request a similar donation of lightweight aggregates to aid us in our upcoming projects. Your materials have proven to be essential to our design and construction process, and we believe they will once again elevate our efforts.

In return for your generous support, we would love to offer you prominent visibility through our sponsorship benefits, including your logo displayed on our canoe hull, recognition on our social media platforms, photos from the competition, acknowledgment in our technical paper, and a certificate of appreciation from NAU.

If you're based in Flagstaff, we would be more than happy to arrange a convenient pickup for the materials, or we can handle the shipping logistics if needed. 

Thank you once again for your past support; it means the world to us. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further and hope to hear from you soon!

Warm regards,
