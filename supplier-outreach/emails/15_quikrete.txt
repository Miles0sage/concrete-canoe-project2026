Subject: Partnership Opportunity with NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Quikrete Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Miles, and I’m a Civil Engineering student at Northern Arizona University, currently serving as a member of the NAU Concrete Canoe Team. We are excited to participate in the upcoming ASCE National Concrete Canoe Competition, where teams showcase their engineering skills by designing, constructing, and racing canoes made entirely of concrete.

As we prepare for this prestigious event, we are reaching out to seek your support through a sponsorship or donation of your Portland cement and concrete mix. Your products are renowned for their quality and performance, which are crucial for us to create a lightweight yet durable canoe that can compete effectively.

By partnering with us, you’ll not only be supporting local NAU students but also showcasing your commitment to education and community development. In return for your generosity, we will prominently display your logo on the hull of our canoe, ensuring visibility at the competition, and recognize you on our social media platforms. Additionally, we will provide photos from the event and acknowledge your support in our technical paper, along with a certificate from NAU.

We understand that logistics can be a concern, and we are more than happy to handle shipping costs for any materials you may provide. 

We would love the chance to discuss this opportunity further and explore how we can work together. I will follow up next week, but please feel free to reach out at (928) 254-9179 if you have any questions or need more information.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to the possibility of partnering with Quikrete!

Best regards,
