**Subject:** Sponsorship Opportunity with NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Store Manager,

I hope this message finds you well! My name is Miles, and I am a Civil Engineering student at Northern Arizona University, representing the NAU Concrete Canoe Team. We are excited to participate in the upcoming ASCE National Concrete Canoe Competition, where student teams design, build, and race concrete canoes, showcasing our engineering skills and creativity.

As a local team, we are passionate about engaging our community and showcasing the talent of NAU students. We are reaching out to Home Depot Flagstaff because we believe your contribution can make a significant difference in our project. Specifically, we are seeking various materials or a gift card to help us procure essential supplies for constructing our canoe, such as concrete mix, reinforcement materials, and finishing supplies.

In return for your support, we would be thrilled to feature your logo on our canoe hull, providing excellent visibility during the competition. Additionally, we will recognize Home Depot on our social media platforms, share photos from the event, and include your company’s name in our technical paper. As a token of our appreciation, we will also provide a certificate of recognition from NAU.

We would be grateful if you could consider donating materials or a gift card to support our efforts. We will handle all logistics, including shipping costs, to ensure a seamless partnership.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to support local NAU students. Please feel free to reach me at (928) 254-9179 if you have any questions or require further information. I look forward to the possibility of working together!

Warm regards,

Miles
