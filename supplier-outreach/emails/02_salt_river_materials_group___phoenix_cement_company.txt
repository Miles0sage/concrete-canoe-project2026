**Subject:** Thank You & Request for Continued Support from NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Clinton and Brian,

I hope this message finds you well. On behalf of the NAU Concrete Canoe Team, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks for your generous donation of Fly ash F and Portland cement Type I and II last year. Your support was instrumental in our success at the regional competition, allowing us to construct a canoe that not only performed remarkably but also showcased the innovative potential of sustainable materials in concrete.

As we gear up for the 2026 season, we are reaching out to kindly request your continued support with a similar donation of Fly ash F and Portland cement. Our partnership with Salt River Materials Group and Phoenix Cement Company is essential to our mission, and your materials directly contribute to the hands-on learning experiences for our engineering team.

In gratitude for your support, we would be thrilled to offer several sponsorship benefits, including your logo prominently displayed on our canoe hull, social media recognition, exclusive photos from our competitions, acknowledgment in our technical paper, and a certificate of appreciation from NAU. 

For your convenience, if you are based in Flagstaff, we would be happy to arrange for pickup of the materials. Alternatively, we can coordinate shipping to ensure a smooth process.

We would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further. Please feel free to contact me at (928) 254-9179. Thank you once again for your invaluable partnership, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Warm regards,
