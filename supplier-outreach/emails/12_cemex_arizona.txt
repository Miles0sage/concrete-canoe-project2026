**Subject:** Sponsorship Opportunity with NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Community Relations Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Miles, and I am a Civil Engineering student at Northern Arizona University, proudly representing the NAU Concrete Canoe Team. We are excited to reach out to CEMEX Arizona, a company renowned for its commitment to university outreach and community support.

The NAU Concrete Canoe Team participates in the prestigious ASCE national competition, where we design, build, and race canoes made entirely of concrete. This innovative project not only challenges our engineering skills but also emphasizes sustainability and teamwork. Our success in the competition heavily relies on the quality of materials we use, particularly Portland cement, which is essential for achieving the desired buoyancy and strength in our canoe.

We would be incredibly grateful if CEMEX Arizona could support us through a donation or sample of your Portland cement. Your contribution will play a vital role in our project and, in return, we would proudly feature your logo on our canoe hull, ensuring visibility during the competition. Additionally, we will recognize your support on our social media platforms, provide photos from the event, acknowledge you in our technical paper, and present you with a certificate of appreciation from NAU.

We are committed to making this partnership easy and efficient, and we will handle all shipping costs if needed. Supporting local NAU students not only enhances our project but also emphasizes CEMEX Arizona's investment in the future of engineering talent.

Thank you for considering our request. I would love to discuss this opportunity further and answer any questions you may have. Please feel free to reach me at (928) 254-9179.

Warm regards,
