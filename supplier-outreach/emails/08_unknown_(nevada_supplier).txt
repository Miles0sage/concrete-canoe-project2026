**Subject:** Thank You & A Request for Continued Support from NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Alyson,

I hope this message finds you well! I want to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for your generous donation of Slag 120 to the NAU Concrete Canoe Team last year. Your support had a profound impact on our project, allowing us to enhance our canoe’s performance and showcase our engineering capabilities at the competition. We are proud to say that with your material, we achieved remarkable results, placing in the top tier at the regional event!

As we gear up for the 2026 season, we would be thrilled to continue our partnership with you and [Company Name]. We kindly request your support again, whether through a donation of Slag 120 or a similar product. In return, we are excited to offer several benefits, including:

- Your logo prominently displayed on our canoe hull during competitions
- Recognition across our social media platforms
- Exclusive photos capturing the excitement of the competition
- Acknowledgment in our technical paper
- A certificate of appreciation from Northern Arizona University

If you are local to Flagstaff, we can conveniently pick up the materials, or we can arrange for shipping if that works better for you. 

Thank you once again for being such a vital part of our team’s success. We would love to discuss how we can work together again this year. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at (928) 254-9179.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Warm regards,
