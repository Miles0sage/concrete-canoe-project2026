**Subject:** Thank You and Request for Continued Support from NAU Concrete Canoe Team

Dear Rashid,

I hope this message finds you well! I want to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for your generous donation of testing cylinders and sieve analysis services last year. Your support played a critical role in the success of our project, allowing us to refine our concrete mix to achieve optimal performance. The impact of your contribution was evident as we competed last season and showcased our canoe's strength and durability.

As we gear up for the 2026 competition season, we would be honored to partner with Western Technologies once again. Your continued support would greatly assist us in procuring the necessary materials and testing services that are vital to our project’s success. We would appreciate a similar donation this year, as it would significantly enhance our capabilities and allow us to push the limits of our design.

In recognition of your generosity, we would proudly feature your logo on our canoe hull, offering great visibility during competitions. Additionally, you would receive social media recognition, competition photos, acknowledgment in our technical paper, and a certificate from NAU to commemorate our partnership.

As a local Flagstaff company, we can easily arrange for pickup of the materials at your convenience, simplifying the logistics involved.

Thank you once again for your past support. I look forward to the opportunity to continue working together and hope to hear from you soon. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at (928) 254-9179.

Warm regards,
