**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity with NAU Concrete Canoe Team  

Dear Education Department,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Miles, and I am a Civil Engineering student at Northern Arizona University, representing the NAU Concrete Canoe Team. We are gearing up for the upcoming ASCE national concrete canoe competition, where student teams from across the country showcase their engineering skills by designing, building, and racing canoes made entirely of concrete.  

We are excited about the possibility of partnering with Sika Corporation, especially given your commitment to supporting educational initiatives and your student sample program. Your innovative admixtures, particularly air-entraining agents and water reducers, are critical to our canoe's performance. These products help enhance the durability and workability of our concrete mix, ensuring our canoe not only floats but excels in competition.  

We would be grateful for any donations or samples of your admixtures to assist us in this endeavor. In return, we would proudly feature your logo on our canoe hull, provide social media recognition throughout the competition season, and send you photos highlighting our journey and success. Additionally, you would receive recognition in our technical paper and a certificate from NAU to commemorate your support.  

We understand that logistics can be a concern; please rest assured that we will handle any shipping costs associated with the materials. We genuinely believe this partnership could benefit both Sika Corporation and the future engineers we represent.  

I would love the opportunity to discuss this further and explore how we can work together. Please feel free to reach out to me at (928) 254-9179 or reply to this email at your convenience.  

Thank you for considering our request, and I look forward to your positive response!  

Best regards,
