**Subject:** Thank You & Exciting Opportunity for Continued Partnership!

---

Dear Daryl,

I hope this message finds you well! On behalf of the NAU Concrete Canoe Team, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks for your generous donation of Carbon carbonite (PC4) last year. Your support was instrumental in our success, allowing us to enhance our design and ultimately secure a podium finish at the regional competition. We truly appreciate your commitment to fostering innovation and education in our engineering pursuits.

As we gear up for the 2026 season, we are reaching out to see if you would consider supporting us once again with a donation of Carbon carbonite (PC4) or a similar material. Your contributions not only help us build a competitive canoe but also forge a lasting partnership that benefits both our team and National Waste & Recycling. 

In return for your support, we would be thrilled to showcase your company’s logo on our canoe hull, ensuring visibility at the competition. Additionally, we would provide prominent social media recognition, photos from the event, acknowledgment in our technical paper, and a certificate of appreciation from NAU.

If you are local to Flagstaff, we would be happy to arrange a convenient pickup. Otherwise, we can coordinate shipping details to make the process as easy as possible for you.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to continue our partnership. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at (928) 254-9179 or via email to discuss this further. We look forward to the possibility of working together again!

Warm regards,
