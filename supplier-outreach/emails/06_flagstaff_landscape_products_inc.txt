**Subject:** Thank You for Your Support & Request for 2026 Season

Dear Flagstaff Landscape Products Inc Team,

I hope this message finds you well! On behalf of the NAU Concrete Canoe Team, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks for your generous donation of red sand last season. The impact of your support was significant, as it enabled us to enhance our canoe's design and performance, ultimately leading to a successful competition. Your contribution truly made a difference, and we are incredibly grateful.

As we gear up for the 2026 season, we are reaching out to see if you would be willing to support us once again with a donation of red sand. We are committed to building on our previous successes and continuing our partnership with local businesses like yours. Your support not only helps us achieve our goals but also fosters community spirit and collaboration.

In appreciation of your sponsorship, we would be thrilled to showcase your company’s logo on our canoe hull, which will be prominently visible during competitions. Additionally, we will provide recognition through our social media channels, share competition photos featuring your logo, and acknowledge your support in our technical paper. You will also receive a certificate from NAU recognizing your valuable contribution.

As a local partner, we can arrange for easy pickup of the red sand, making the logistics straightforward for you. 

We would love to discuss this opportunity further and hope to continue our partnership. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at (928) 254-9179.

Thank you once again for your invaluable support, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Warm regards,
