1. Open `PRESENTATION_CHEAT_SHEET.md`
2. Read it start to finish
3. **Memorize the 30-second elevator pitch**
4. **Memorize the 3-step physics workflow:**
   - Hydrostatics (will it float?)
   - Stability (will it tip?)
   - Structural (will it break?)

### STEP 2: Build Your Slides (1 hour)
1. Open PowerPoint or Google Slides
2. Open `PRESENTATION_SLIDE_DECK.md`
3. Copy the text from each slide (Slides 1-21)
4. Insert your figures:
   - Figure 1: `reports/figures/3_designs_profiles.png`

2. Practice the thin-shell slide (Slide 7) — pause after showing 1,452 vs 85
3. Practice the elevator pitch (30 seconds)
4. Practice answering: "How do you know your code is right?"

**Total prep time: 2 hours → You're ready to present!**

## 🎯 THE 3 THINGS JUDGES MUST REMEMBER

If judges only remember 3 things from your presentation, make it these:

### 1. **The Thin-Shell Innovation** (Slide 7)
> "Most teams treat the canoe like a solid beam — that's WRONG. We modeled it as a U-shaped shell. Our section modulus is 85 in³, not 1,452. That's why we could make a 224 lb canoe that's safe — we knew the TRUE strength."

**Why it matters:** This is your competitive advantage. Other teams can't make their canoes lighter because they don't know the real strength.

### 2. **Automation & Validation** (Slides 10-12)
> "We built a robot engineer that tests designs automatically. 60 automated tests catch errors. We generated 3 complete designs in 10 seconds. Manual teams take 9 hours. That's the power of computational engineering."

**Why it matters:** Shows you're using modern engineering practices (NASA, SpaceX level).

### 3. **Data-Driven Optimization** (Slide 8)
> "We didn't guess — we tested 3 designs scientifically. Design A is 51 lbs lighter than our original, passes all requirements with margin, and is proven by 60 tests and comparison to real canoe data."

**Why it matters:** Shows systematic engineering process, not trial-and-error.

---

## 💡 THE PRESENTATION STRATEGY

### Your Competitive Edge
Most teams will say: *"We designed a canoe and calculated it's safe."*

You will say: *"We built a computational design system that explored the design space, optimized for competition scoring, and validated every calculation with automated tests."*

**See the difference?** You're not just presenting a canoe — you're presenting an ENGINEERING CAPABILITY.

### The Narrative Arc
1. **Problem:** Manual calculations are slow and error-prone (Slide 2)
2. **Solution:** We built automation (Slide 3)
3. **Innovation:** Thin-shell modeling (Slide 7)
4. **Process:** Systematic design exploration (Slide 8)
5. **Validation:** 60 tests prove it works (Slide 10)
6. **Result:** 224 lb canoe, all requirements pass (Slide 16)

This tells a STORY, not just a list of facts.

## 🔥 THE "WOW" MOMENTS (Plan These Carefully)

### WOW Moment 1: The Thin-Shell Reveal (Slide 7)
**Setup:** "Let me show you why our canoe is 51 lbs lighter..."
**Reveal:** Show side-by-side: 1,452 in³ (wrong) vs. 85 in³ (correct)
**Pause:** Let it sink in. Count to 3.
**Punchline:** "That's a 17× difference. THAT'S why we could optimize weight safely."

### WOW Moment 2: The 10-Second Design (Slide 12)
**Setup:** "How long does it take to analyze a design?"
**Reveal:** "Manual teams: 3 hours. Our code: 10 seconds."
**Visual:** Show the automation flowchart (all 3 designs running in parallel)
**Punchline:** "We can explore 100 variations in the time it takes them to check one."

### WOW Moment 3: The 60 Tests (Slide 10)
**Setup:** "How do we know our code is right?"
**Reveal:** "60 automated tests. Every calculation validated."
**Visual:** Show test results screenshot (60/60 PASSING)
**Punchline:** "This is how NASA validates rocket software. We applied the same standards."

## 🎤 DELIVERY TIPS

### Body Language
- **Slides 4-7:** Stand still, speak slowly (this is where judges evaluate your technical knowledge)
- **Slide 7:** Point at the screen when showing 1,452 vs 85
- **Slide 8:** Physically point to Design A star when recommending it
- **Slide 12:** Use hand gestures to show speed (snap fingers for "10 seconds")

### Pacing
- **Fast:** Slides 1-3 (everyone knows the problem)
- **SLOW:** Slides 4-7 (judges are evaluating you here)
- **Medium:** Slides 8-16 (technical details)
- **Fast:** Slides 17-21 (wrap-up)

### Voice Modulation
- **Excited:** When talking about innovation (thin-shell, automation)
- **Confident:** When talking about validation (60 tests, published data)
- **Humble:** When talking about lessons learned
- **Proud:** When presenting final results

### Eye Contact
- **Judges:** 80% of the time
- **Slides:** 15% (only when pointing to specific data)
- **Team:** 5% (for moral support)

## 🛡️ HANDLING TOUGH QUESTIONS

### Q: "Your code could have bugs. How do you know it's right?"

**GOOD Answer:**
> "Three layers of validation: (1) 60 unit tests against known physics — like checking that 100 lbs displaces exactly 1.60 cubic feet. (2) Comparison to published data — our GM values match recreational kayaks within 5%. (3) Dimensional analysis — we check units at every step. Plus it's open-source on GitHub — anyone can audit the code."

**BAD Answer:**
> "We tested it and it seems to work." ← Too vague!

### Q: "Why not just use Excel?"

**GOOD Answer:**
> "Excel is great for simple calculations, but our analysis has 60+ steps. We needed automation for rapid iteration, testing to catch errors, and repeatability. Python is the industry standard for this — NASA uses Python for mission planning. Excel can't run 60 automated tests."

**BAD Answer:**
> "Because Python is better." ← Too dismissive!

### Q: "Explain how you calculated GM."

**GOOD Answer:**
> "GM equals KB plus BM minus KG. KB is the buoyancy center at draft over 2. BM is the metacentric radius — we use the full formula I_wp divided by V, where I_wp is the second moment of waterplane area. That's Lines 119-125 in our code. KG is the weighted center of gravity from hull and crew components. For Design A, that's 2.5 plus 7.8 minus 3.2 equals 7.1 inches."

**BAD Answer:**
> "We used a formula from a textbook." ← Too hand-wavy!

### Q: "What if your weight estimate is wrong?"

**GOOD Answer:**
> "Great question! We have validation built-in. Line 403 warns if our estimate differs from user input by more than 20%. We also compared our estimates to published canoe data — we're within 5% for similar dimensions. Finally, we build in safety margin — our lightest design has a safety factor of 22.5, so even if weight is 10% higher, we'd still have SF over 20."

**BAD Answer:**
> "It should be pretty accurate." ← Doesn't inspire confidence!

## 🚀 THE MOMENT BEFORE YOU GO ON STAGE

**Last-Minute Ritual (30 seconds):**

1. Deep breath in (4 counts)
2. Hold (4 counts)
3. Breathe out (4 counts)
4. Repeat 3 times

5. Say to yourself:
   > "I built something amazing. I understand it completely. I'm going to show them real engineering."

6. Remember the elevator pitch:
   > "Our code is like having a robot engineer that tests 100 canoe designs in an hour, checks all the physics, and writes perfect reports — we just had to teach it the rules once."

7. Smile. Walk confidently to the front.

8. **You got this.** 💯

## 📞 LAST-MINUTE HELP

If you're reading this 5 minutes before presenting and panicking:

### Focus on ONLY these 3 slides:
- **Slide 7:** Thin-shell innovation (1,452 vs 85)
- **Slide 8:** Design comparison table (Design A wins)
- **Slide 10:** Validation (60 tests)

### Memorize ONLY this:
> "We built code that designs canoes automatically. Our key innovation is modeling the hull as a thin shell instead of a solid beam — that's why we could make a 224 lb canoe that's safe. We validated everything with 60 automated tests and comparison to real data. Design A passes all requirements and is 51 lbs lighter than our original."

**That's enough to succeed.** Everything else is bonus points.

## 🎉 FINAL MESSAGE

You've done incredible work. You didn't just design a canoe — you built a **computational engineering system** that will help future NAU teams for years to come.

Your code represents:
- **Professional software practices** (version control, testing, documentation)
- **Real engineering innovation** (thin-shell modeling)
- **Systematic optimization** (data-driven design selection)
- **Modern computational methods** (automation, validation, repeatability)

Most importantly: **You UNDERSTAND it.**

Every line of code. Every formula. Every design decision.

When judges ask questions, you can point to EXACT code lines. You can explain the physics. You can justify your choices with data.

**That's what separates good engineers from great ones.**

So go out there and show them what real engineering looks like.

**YOU. GOT. THIS.** 🚀🏆🎉
