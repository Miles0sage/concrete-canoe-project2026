# NAU Concrete Canoe 2026 — Video Script v2 (Non-Coder Friendly, ~5 Minutes)

## 0:00–0:30 — The Problem

**[SHOW: Title card with NAU logo → 2025 competition photo]**

> "The NAU ASCE Concrete Canoe team found a major problem during the 2025 competition. Our canoe was not stable enough in the water. During turning events, the canoe nearly flipped over. The technical term is low metacentric height, which basically means the canoe's center of gravity was too high relative to its shape in the water."

## 0:30–0:50 — Our Solution

**[SHOW: Computer screen with calculator → presentation_how_it_works.png]**

> "For 2026, we went back to the drawing board. We built a computer program that tests thousands of hull shapes to find the best one. Think of it like a virtual wind tunnel, but for canoes."

## 0:50–1:30 — What We Check

**[SHOW: presentation_how_it_works.png flowchart → animated checks]**

> "Here's what our program checks. First, weight: how heavy will the finished canoe be? Second, freeboard: how much of the canoe sits above the waterline when loaded. More freeboard means less chance of water splashing in. Third, stability: will the canoe resist tipping? Measured by something called G M, or metacentric height. Higher is better. Fourth, strength: will the hull crack under load? We calculate a safety factor. Above one means safe. Ours is over one hundred."

## 1:30–1:50 — Monte Carlo Testing

**[SHOW: presentation_monte_carlo_simple.png]**

> "To make sure our design works even when things aren't perfect, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation. We tested the design one thousand times, each time slightly changing concrete density, wall thickness, and paddler weights. Result: one hundred percent pass rate."

## 1:50–2:40 — Three Designs

**[SHOW: presentation_design_comparison.png → 3D hull renders]**

> "We created three hull designs.
>
> Design A, our recommendation: sixteen feet long, two and a half feet wide, seventeen inches deep, at one hundred seventy-four pounds. The lightest option.
>
> Design B, the conservative choice: slightly larger, at one hundred eighty-eight pounds. Extra safety margin.
>
> Design C, the traditional option: eighteen feet long, two hundred fourteen pounds. Easiest to build.
>
> All three pass every competition requirement."

**[SHOW: presentation_why_design_A.png → presentation_key_numbers.png]**

> "Design A stands out: twenty-eight percent lighter than the maximum allowed, eleven inches of freeboard, nine point five inches of stability, and a structural safety factor over one hundred."

## 2:40–2:55 — Interactive Dashboard

**[SHOW: Dashboard screenshot / screen recording]**

> "We also built a web dashboard where you can adjust canoe dimensions with sliders and see results instantly. No coding needed."

## 2:55–4:20 — Construction (Female Mold Process)

**[SHOW: construction_step1_mold_build.png]**

> "Now, how we actually build this canoe. We're using a female mold process. That means we build a hollow mold and form the canoe inside it, giving us a smooth outer surface."

**[SHOW: construction_step1 → step2 → step3 → etc., one per narration segment]**

> "Step one: Build the mold. We cut the hull shape from E P S foam. Thirty-two foam cross-sections are cut on a C N C machine and mounted six inches apart on a plywood spine called a strongback. We fill between the sections and sand everything smooth."
>
> "Step two: Prepare the mold surface. Two coats of P V A release agent so the concrete won't stick."
>
> "Step three: Place the reinforcement. Basalt fiber mesh goes into the mold. This prevents cracking and adds strength."
>
> "Step four: Apply the concrete. We hand-place our lightweight mix in two lifts. A second layer of mesh goes between the lifts. Total thickness is just half an inch."

**[SHOW: construction_step5_curing.png]**

> "Step five: Cure. We cover the canoe in plastic and keep it moist for seven days minimum."

**[SHOW: construction_step6_demold.png → construction_step7_finishing.png]**

> "Step six: Demold with a six-person team. Step seven: Finish — sand, seal, and apply team graphics."

**[SHOW: construction_materials_list.png]**

> "Material cost: five hundred eighty dollars for the canoe, eight hundred fifty for the mold."

## 4:20–4:50 — Timeline & Next Steps

**[SHOW: construction_overview_timeline.png]**

> "Our timeline: finalize concrete mix by February fifteenth, start the mold by March first, pour concrete by April first, and be competition-ready by April fifteenth."

---

## 4:50–5:00 — Closing

**[SHOW: 3D hull render → team photo → closing title card]**

> "We're confident Design A gives NAU the best combination of light weight, stability, strength, and buildability for the 2026 ASCE Concrete Canoe competition. Thank you for your time."
