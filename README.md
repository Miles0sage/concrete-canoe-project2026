# NAU Concrete Canoe Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
Repository for NAU engineering students building a concrete canoe. This project demonstrates advanced materials science, structural engineering, and innovative construction techniques.

## 📊 Key Material Sourcing Strategy: Poraver

### Critical Discovery ✅
**Poraver doesn't donate directly to end users** - this is actually GREAT news for our strategy!

### Updated Sourcing Plan

#### ❌ Old Approach (Ineffective)
- Email Poraver directly → They redirect to retailers
- Wait for international shipping responses
- Cold outreach with no local connection

#### ✅ New Approach (Optimized)
1. **Target Local Flagstaff Suppliers**
   - Call ready-mix concrete suppliers
   - Visit building material distributors
   - Check with specialized construction supply stores

2. **Leverage Local Advantage**
   - Face-to-face meetings > cold emails
   - "Supporting NAU engineering students" resonates locally
   - Immediate pickup capability (no shipping logistics)
   - Build long-term Flagstaff community relationships

3. **Key Message Points**
   - NAU student engineering project
   - Educational/academic purpose
   - Small quantity needed for prototype
   - Can pick up today/this week
   - Recognition opportunity (project documentation/presentations)

### Priority Contacts - Flagstaff Area

**Flagstaff Ready Mix**
- Primary target for Poraver or lightweight aggregate alternatives
- Local supplier more likely to donate/discount for NAU students
- Face-to-face meeting recommended

**Additional Suppliers to Contact:**
- Building material suppliers in Flagstaff
- Concrete specialty shops
- Construction material distributors

## 📂 Repository Structure

```

├── material-sourcing/     # Supplier contacts, pricing, donation requests
├── design/                # CAD files, calculations, hull design
├── construction/          # Build process, techniques, photos
├── testing/               # Load tests, water tests, performance data
└── documentation/         # Reports, presentations, final documentation
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review Material Sourcing Strategy**
   - See `material-sourcing/README.md` for phone scripts
   - Check supplier contact list
   - Prepare donation pitch

2. **Design Phase**
   - Review hull design requirements
   - Calculate material quantities needed
   - Plan construction timeline

3. **Track Progress**
   - Update supplier contact logs
   - Document all material acquisitions
   - Record construction milestones

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Call Flagstaff Ready Mix (use phone script in `material-sourcing/`)
2. Visit local building suppliers this week
3. Prepare 2-minute elevator pitch for face-to-face meetings
4. Track all contacts and responses

## 🤝 Contributing

Team members: Update this repository with:
- Supplier contact results
- Material test data
- Construction progress photos
- Design iterations

## 📝 Notes

- Local suppliers are KEY to success
- Face-to-face > email for donations
- Small quantities make us ideal donation candidates
- Community/educational angle is our strength
