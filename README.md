# NAU Concrete Canoe 2026

**Team:** Northern Arizona University Civil Engineering  
**Competition:** ASCE Pacific Southwest Regional 2026  
**Captain:** Miles (@Miles0sage)

## Project Overview

Designing and building a concrete canoe that floats, races competitively, and showcases innovative civil engineering.

### Target Specifications
- **Unit Weight:** 65 PCF (pounds per cubic foot)
- **Hull Thickness:** 0.25-0.375 inches
- **Length:** 20 feet (competition requirement)
- **Crew:** 2 paddlers
- **Strength:** Minimum 1000 PSI compressive strength

## Current Status

- [x] Team formed
- [x] Initial research phase
- [x] Supplier outreach initiated (UPDATED: Poraver says contact local retailers!)
- [ ] Mix design finalized
- [ ] Mold construction
- [ ] Hull fabrication
- [ ] Testing & iteration
- [ ] Competition (Spring 2026)

## Key Materials

### Critical Components
1. **Poraver Expanded Glass** (SG 0.3) - Lightweight aggregate ⚠️ ESSENTIAL
2. **Portland Cement** Type I/II
3. **Admixtures** - Air entraining, water reducers
4. **Reinforcement** - Glass fiber mesh

### Supplier Strategy - UPDATED Feb 4, 2026

**Poraver Feedback:** They said to contact **local retailers** instead of direct manufacturer.

**New Priority:**
1. 🔴 **Local Flagstaff Suppliers** (Can pickup, community connection)
   - Flagstaff Ready Mix - cement, sand, aggregate
   - Home Depot Flagstaff - community grants, might carry Poraver
   - Local masonry supply stores - call about Poraver availability

2. 🟡 **Regional Cement** (Arizona suppliers support AZ students)
   - CalPortland
   - CEMEX Arizona

3. 🟢 **Admixture Sample Programs** (Educational donations)
   - Sika Corporation (education@sika.com)
   - BASF Master Builders
   - GCP Applied Technologies

## Mix Design Philosophy

**Target:** 65 PCF unit weight with >1000 PSI strength

**Strategy:**
- Maximize Poraver content (reduce density)
- Optimize water/cement ratio (maintain strength)
- Air entraining admixture (lighter + durable)
- Minimal coarse aggregate

**Reference Mixes:**
- UC Berkeley 2019: 62 PCF, 1200 PSI
- Colorado School of Mines 2020: 68 PCF, 1500 PSI
- NAU Target: 65 PCF, 1000+ PSI

## Testing Plan

1. **Phase 1:** Trial mixes (3-5 variations)
2. **Phase 2:** Compression testing (ASTM C39)
3. **Phase 3:** Density verification
4. **Phase 4:** Workability assessment
5. **Phase 5:** Final mix selection
6. **Phase 6:** Hull construction

## Competition Timeline

- **February 2026:** Materials secured, mix design finalized
- **March 2026:** Mold construction, hull fabrication
- **April 2026:** Testing, final finish, presentation prep
- **May 2026:** ASCE Pacific Southwest Regional Competition

## Sponsors
