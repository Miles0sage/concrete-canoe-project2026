# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - First Steps

## Immediate Action Items (This Week!)

### 1. Research Flagstaff Suppliers (Today - 30 minutes)
Google these search terms:
- "Flagstaff ready mix concrete"
- "Flagstaff building materials supplier"
- "Flagstaff construction supply"
- "Northern Arizona lightweight aggregate"

Create a list of 5-10 phone numbers to call.

### 2. Make Your First Calls (Tomorrow - 1 hour)

#### Before Calling:
- [ ] Review phone script in `material-sourcing/README.md`
- [ ] Have pen and paper ready for notes
- [ ] Call during business hours (9am-4pm, avoid lunch)
- [ ] Be prepared to explain what a concrete canoe is!

#### Your Opening Line:
> "Hi! My name is _____, and I'm a student at NAU. We're working on 
> an engineering project building a concrete canoe, and I'm looking 
> for Poraver or lightweight aggregate. Do you carry anything like that?"

#### What to Listen For:
- ✅ "Yes, we have that" → Ask about donation/student discount!
- ✅ "We don't, but try..." → Get that referral!
- ❌ "Never heard of it" → Ask about lightweight aggregates in general
- ❌ "We can order it" → Ask about minimum quantities and cost

### 3. Target #1: Flagstaff Ready Mix
**Why them first?** Ready-mix suppliers are most likely to have or know about specialty aggregates.

**What to say:**
> "I'm calling about lightweight aggregates for a concrete canoe project at NAU. 
> Do you stock or have access to Poraver or similar expanded glass products?"

**If positive response:**
> "That's great! We need a small quantity - maybe 10-20 pounds - for a student 
> project. Would you consider donating or offering a student discount? We'd be 
> happy to acknowledge your support in our project presentation."

### 4. Document Everything!
After each call, immediately write down:
- Company name
- Person you spoke with
- What they said
- Next steps
- Follow-up date if needed

Use the template in `material-sourcing/README.md`

## Your First Week Goals

### Day 1 (Today)
- [x] Repository set up ✅
- [ ] Research 10 Flagstaff suppliers
- [ ] Get phone numbers and addresses
- [ ] Read phone scripts in material-sourcing folder

### Day 2
- [ ] Call 5 suppliers
- [ ] Document all responses
- [ ] Follow up on any leads

### Day 3
- [ ] Visit 1-2 promising suppliers in person
- [ ] Bring: Student ID, business card if available, brief project description
- [ ] Ask to speak with manager/purchasing department

### Day 4-5
- [ ] Follow up on pending responses
- [ ] Research alternative materials if Poraver unavailable
- [ ] Start planning mix design tests

## Why This Strategy Works

### Local suppliers are better because:
1. **Face-to-face builds trust** - They can see you're real students
2. **Convenience for them** - No shipping, easy handoff
3. **Community connection** - NAU is part of Flagstaff
4. **Small quantities** - Perfect for donations vs. bulk orders
5. **Recognition** - Local businesses like supporting education

### You're not asking for much:
- 10-20 lbs of aggregate (vs. tons for commercial projects)
- Educational purpose (tax deductible for them)
- Easy logistics (you pick up)
- Good publicity (you'll acknowledge them)

## Handling Objections

**"We don't donate materials"**
→ "I understand! Would a student discount be possible? Even 10% would help our project budget significantly."

**"You need to contact the manufacturer"**
→ "We tried that, but they said to work with local distributors. Do you have a contact at your supplier you could connect me with?"

**"That's too specialized for us"**
→ "What about other lightweight aggregates? We're open to alternatives that could work for lightweight concrete."

**"Call us back in a few weeks"**
→ "No problem! Who should I ask for when I call back?" [Get a name!]

## Success Tips

1. **Be enthusiastic!** Your energy is contagious
2. **Be professional** - You represent NAU
3. **Be specific** - "10-20 lbs for a concrete canoe" is clear
4. **Be flexible** - Alternative materials are fine!
5. **Be grateful** - Thank everyone, even for "no" answers
6. **Be persistent** - It might take 10 calls to get 1 yes
