# MIX-001: Baseline Poraver Mix

**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Designer:** Miles  
**Status:** Design phase (pending materials)

## Design Goals

- **Target Density:** 65 PCF
- **Target Strength:** 1000-1200 PSI (28 days)
- **Workability:** Medium (4-6 inch slump)
- **Cost:** Minimize through donations

## Proportions (by weight)

Based on UC Berkeley 2019 lightweight concrete canoe reference.

| Material | Weight (lbs) | Percentage | Notes |
|----------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Portland Cement Type I/II | 10.0 | 29% | Primary binder |
| Poraver 0.5-1mm | 4.0 | 12% | Fine lightweight aggregate |
| Poraver 1-2mm | 6.0 | 17% | Coarse lightweight aggregate |
| Fine sand | 8.0 | 23% | Workability, strength |
| Water | 6.5 | 19% | W/C ratio = 0.65 |
| Air entraining agent | 0.05 | 0.1% | Micro-bubbles |
| Water reducer | 0.05 | 0.1% | Workability |
| **TOTAL** | **34.6** | **100%** | |

## Calculated Properties

- **Water/Cement Ratio:** 0.65
- **Expected Density:** 64-66 PCF
- **Expected Strength:** 1000-1200 PSI (28 days)
- **Expected 7-day Strength:** 700-850 PSI
- **Poraver Content:** 29% by weight (high for buoyancy)
- **Cement Content:** 29% by weight (for strength)

## Mixing Procedure

1. **Pre-soak Poraver** (5 min) - Prevent water absorption during mix
2. **Dry mix:** Cement + sand (2 min)
3. **Add Poraver gradually** (1 min) - Gentle to avoid crushing
4. **Mix water + admixtures** separately (30 sec)
5. **Add water mixture** to dry ingredients (30 sec)
6. **Final mix** (3 min) - Until uniform, avoid over-mixing
7. **Total time:** ~12 minutes

## Testing Plan

### Test Cylinders
- Make **6 cylinders** (4x8 inch, ASTM C192)
- Test 3 at 7 days
- Test 3 at 28 days

### Measurements
- Fresh density (ASTM C138)
- Slump test (ASTM C143)
- Compression strength (ASTM C39)
- Visual workability assessment

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Density: 63-67 PCF (within target range)
- ✅ Strength: >1000 PSI at 28 days
- ✅ Workability: Can be troweled smoothly
- ✅ No segregation or bleeding

## Material Sources

| Material | Preferred Source | Backup Source | Status |
|----------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Cement | Flagstaff Ready Mix (donation) | Home Depot ($50) | Pending |
| Poraver | Local retailer (researching) | Online ($200) | Pending |
| Sand | Flagstaff Ready Mix (donation) | Home Depot ($15) | Pending |
| Air entraining | Sika sample program | Purchase ($40) | Pending |
| Water reducer | BASF sample program | Purchase ($40) | Pending |

**Estimated Cost:** $0 (if all donations) / $345 (if all purchased)

## Design Notes

### Why This Mix?

1. **High Poraver content (29%)** - Reduces density significantly
2. **Moderate cement (29%)** - Balances strength vs weight
3. **Fine sand (23%)** - Improves workability and fill
4. **Low W/C ratio (0.65)** - Maintains strength
5. **Admixtures** - Air entraining for micro-bubbles, water reducer for workability

### Potential Adjustments

If testing shows:
- **Too heavy (>67 PCF):** Increase Poraver, decrease sand
- **Too weak (<900 PSI):** Increase cement, decrease water
- **Poor workability:** Increase water reducer, adjust sand
- **Segregation:** Reduce water, increase mixing time

### Comparison to Normal Concrete

| Property | Normal Concrete | This Mix | Reduction |
|----------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Density | 150 PCF | 65 PCF | 57% lighter |
| Cement | 15-20% | 29% | Higher % |
| Aggregate SG | 2.6-2.7 | 0.3 (Poraver) | 88% lower |
| Strength | 3000-4000 PSI | 1000-1200 PSI | Lower but adequate |

## Next Steps

1. Secure Poraver source (local retailer or purchase)
2. Confirm cement donation (Flagstaff Ready Mix)
3. Obtain admixture samples (Sika, BASF)
4. Mix test batch (3 cubic feet)
5. Test cylinders at 7 and 28 days
6. Adjust mix based on results
7. Finalize mix for hull construction
