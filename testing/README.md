# Testing Phase

## 🧪 Testing Overview

Comprehensive testing ensures the concrete canoe is safe, functional, and competition-ready. Document all test results for project reports and future iterations.

## 📋 Testing Categories

### 1. Material Testing (Pre-Construction)
Test concrete mix properties before committing to full build.

### 2. Structural Testing (Post-Construction)
Verify canoe can handle loads and stresses.

### 3. Water Testing (Progressive)
Ensure floatation, stability, and paddling performance.

## 🔬 Material Testing Protocol

### Test Batch Evaluation

#### Compressive Strength Test
**Purpose:** Verify concrete achieves adequate strength
**Method:** 
1. Create test cylinders (3" diameter x 6" height)
2. Cure alongside canoe construction
3. Test at 7-day and 28-day intervals
4. Compare to design requirements

**Target:** >2000 psi minimum

#### Density Test
**Purpose:** Confirm lightweight properties
**Method:**
1. Measure volume of test sample
2. Weigh sample precisely
3. Calculate density (lbs/cubic ft)

**Target:** <90 lbs/cubic ft (lighter = better)

#### Workability Test
**Purpose:** Ensure mix is applicable to mold
**Method:**
1. Slump test (if applicable)
2. Trowel test - ease of application
3. Set time observation

**Target:** Smooth application, 30-60 min working time

## 🏋️ Structural Testing

### Visual Inspection
**Pre-water test checklist:**
- [ ] No visible cracks >1mm
- [ ] Edges intact and smooth
- [ ] Reinforcement not exposed
- [ ] Uniform thickness throughout
- [ ] Waterproofing complete

### Load Testing (Dry)
**Purpose:** Verify structural integrity before water exposure

#### Test 1: Static Load
1. Support canoe at gunwales
2. Place 200 lbs weight in center
3. Inspect for flexing/cracking
4. Increase load gradually to 400 lbs
5. Document any deflection or sounds

**Pass criteria:** No cracks, minimal flexing, no concerning sounds

#### Test 2: Point Load
1. Apply 50 lbs at various single points
2. Simulate paddler sitting, kneeling positions
3. Check for stress concentrations

**Pass criteria:** No localized cracking or deformation

### Documentation Requirements
- Photographs before/after each test
- Measurements of any deflection
- Written observations
- Pass/fail determination

## 🌊 Water Testing Protocol

### Test 1: Float Test (Unloaded)
**Location:** Controlled environment (pool recommended)
**Purpose:** Basic buoyancy verification

**Procedure:**
1. Place canoe in water
2. Observe waterline
3. Check for leaks
4. Verify stability when empty

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Floats with freeboard >6 inches
- [ ] No water intrusion
- [ ] Stable when disturbed

### Test 2: Single Paddler Test
**Purpose:** Verify performance with one person

**Procedure:**
1. Single paddler enters carefully
2. Sit/kneel in center position
3. Assess stability
4. Paddle short distance (10-20 feet)
5. Exit and inspect canoe

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Freeboard >4 inches
- [ ] Stable enough to paddle
- [ ] No water intrusion
- [ ] No structural issues post-test

### Test 3: Two Paddler Test
**Purpose:** Full load capacity test

**Procedure:**
1. Two paddlers board (bow and stern positions)
2. Assess freeboard and stability
3. Paddle course (50-100 feet)
4. Test turning, backing maneuvers
5. Exit and conduct full inspection

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Adequate freeboard (>2 inches)
- [ ] Controllable and paddleable
- [ ] Comfortable for crew
- [ ] No structural damage

### Test 4: Endurance Test
**Purpose:** Extended use simulation

**Procedure:**
1. Two paddlers complete 15-30 minute session
2. Paddle various conditions (straight, turns, waves)
3. Monitor for any developing issues
4. Post-test inspection

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] No progressive water intrusion
- [ ] No structural deterioration
- [ ] Maintains performance throughout
- [ ] Crew reports acceptable handling

## ⚠️ Safety During Testing

### Water Test Safety Requirements
- [ ] Life jackets for all participants
- [ ] Safety personnel on shore
- [ ] First aid kit on site
- [ ] Phone for emergencies
- [ ] Calm water conditions only
